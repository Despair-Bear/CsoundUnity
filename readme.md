#### Csound wrapper for the Unity3d game engine.

This simple wrapper is based on Richard Henninger's Csound6Net .NET wrapper. If you wish to 
use the Csound API in a model that is idiomatic to .net please use his wrapper instead.

When compiling on Windows with Visual Studio, make sure that .NET is set to 3.5.
