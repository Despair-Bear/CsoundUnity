It extends Unity's audio API by creating Csound-based AudioSource objects that can interact and exist alongside regular AudioSource objects. \nWith CsoundUnity, games developers have at their fingertips one of the most powerful synthesis systems in existence. \n\nPlease visit homepage: http://rorywalsh.github.io/CsoundUnity/ \n\nThis interface would not have been possible without Richard Henninger's .NET interface to the Csound API.",
