{\bfseries{Changes from 2.\+3}}

{\bfseries{New Features}}
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Restructured the code in the form of a Unity Package (\href{https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/PackagesList.html}{\texttt{ https\+://docs.\+unity3d.\+com/\+Manual/\+Packages\+List.\+html}}).
\item Updated libraries to {\bfseries{\mbox{\hyperlink{namespace_csound}{Csound}} 6.\+15}}.
\item Implemented most of the \mbox{\hyperlink{namespace_csound}{Csound}} API.
\item Several improvements of the Editor inspector\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Now the changes made to the {\itshape Control Channels} found in the csd are correctly serialised and saved in the Scene, and are fully compatible with Unity Inspector presets.
\item Added Edit Csd Section, to be able to edit the csd from Unity, and save its content on disk.
\item Added Test Score Section, to be able to send score to Unity when testing in Editor.
\item Added {\bfseries{Audio\+Channels}}\+: the csd file is scanned for {\itshape chnseta} opcodes, and the resulting Audio Channels can be seen in the inspector, and publicly accessed from a dictionary.
\item Added folded groups\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Settings
\item Edit Csd Section
\item Test Score Section
\item Control Channels
\item Audio\+Channels
\end{DoxyItemize}
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Added {\bfseries{\mbox{\hyperlink{class_csound_unity_child}{Csound\+Unity\+Child}}}}, to be able to read audio from the Audio\+Channels of a \mbox{\hyperlink{class_csound_unity}{Csound\+Unity}} instance.
\item Added {\bfseries{Csound\+File\+Watcher}} to detect changes made by an external program to the csds used in the scene, and update them. Add {\itshape FILEWATCHER\+\_\+\+ON} in your project {\itshape Scripting Define Symbols}.
\item Added Android libraries, builds working on {\bfseries{Android 64bit}}.
\item Added an utility method to load samples from Audio\+Clips (currently from Resources folder only).
\item Added Create\+Table methods, to be able to create \mbox{\hyperlink{namespace_csound}{Csound}} tables from float arrays.
\item Added a toggle to show warnings and hard filtering output samples with values higher than a threshold.
\item {\bfseries{Cabbage widgets}}\+: Added support for {\itshape Combo\+Boxes}.
\item Added Is\+Initialized property and On\+Csound\+Initialized event.
\item Added Performance\+Finished property.
\item Added Samples\+: {\itshape \mbox{\hyperlink{namespace_csound}{Csound}} Test}, {\itshape Basic Test}, {\itshape \mbox{\hyperlink{class_csound_unity_child}{Csound\+Unity\+Child}} Test}, {\itshape Simple \mbox{\hyperlink{class_sequencer}{Sequencer}}}, {\itshape Audio\+Clip Reader}.
\item Overriding the sample rate and control rate of the csd using Unity Audio Project Settings.
\item Improved Logging.
\item Updated {\bfseries{mac\+OS library}} to use a .bundle instead of a .framework, to be able to build for mac\+OS straight out of the box.
\item Totally removed the need to use the Streaming\+Assets folder to store csds, libraries and audio files, the csd is saved into the \mbox{\hyperlink{class_csound_unity}{Csound\+Unity}} instance as soon as it is dragged in the {\itshape Csd Asset} inspector field.
\item Removed the overwriting of the {\itshape Path} variable of the operating system.
\end{DoxyItemize}
